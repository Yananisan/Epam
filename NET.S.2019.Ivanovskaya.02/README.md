1. Given two integer signed four byte numbers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j). Implement the InsertNumber algorithm for inserting bits from the j-th to the i-th bit of one number into another so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit j to bit i (the bits are numbered from right to left). Develop unit tests (NUnit and (!) MS Unit Test) to test the method.
2. Implement the FindNextBiggerNumber method, which takes a positive integer and returns the closest largest integer consisting of the digits of the original number, and - 1 (null) if no such number exists. Develop unit tests (NUnit or MS Unit Test) to test the method.
3. Add to the FindNextBiggerNumber method the ability to return the time of finding a given number by considering various language features. Develop unit tests (NUnit or MS Unit Test) to test the method.
4. Implement the FilterDigit method which accepts a list of integers and filters the list so that only numbers containing the specified digit are left at the output. LINQ not to use! For example, for the number 7, FilterDigit (7.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,68,69,70, 15,17) -> {7, 70, 17}. Develop unit tests (NUnit or MS Unit Test) to test the method.
5. Implement the FindNthRoot algorithm, which allows to calculate the n-th root (n? N) of a number (a? R) by the Newton method with a given accuracy. Develop unit tests (NUnit and / or MS Unit Test) to test the method.

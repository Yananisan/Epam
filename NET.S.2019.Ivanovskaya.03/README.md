1. Develop a class that allows you to perform GCD calculations using the Euclidean algorithm for two, three, etc. integers. Class methods in addition to calculating the GCD should determine the value of the time required to perform the calculation. Add to the developed class methods that implement the Stein algorithm (binary Euclidean algorithm) to calculate the GCD of two, three, etc. integers. Methods must also determine the time required to perform the calculations. Develop unit tests for testing methods of this type.
2. Implement the extension method to get a string binary representation of a real double-precision number in IEEE 754 format (it is advisable not to use ready-made converter classes). Develop unit tests.
